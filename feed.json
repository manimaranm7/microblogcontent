				"content_html": "<img src=\"uploads/2025/9c1cf9476e.png\" alt=\"\">\n<p><em>From Bangalore’s hand-etched circuits to RC2014 kits — a journey rewired</em></p>\n<p>On the 20th of September 2025, my daughter and I spent a day at the National Museum of Computing (<a href=\"http://www.tnmoc.org/\">TNMOC</a>) in Bletchley Park for the <a href=\"https://rc2014.co.uk/\">RC2014 </a> assembly <a href=\"https://rc2014.co.uk/3855/rc2014-assembly-v1-0/\">event</a>. It was, without exaggeration, one of the most special visits I’ve ever made to the museum—and I’ve been there countless times.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-place-that-never-loses-its-charm\">A Place That Never Loses Its Charm</h2>\n<p>My first visit to Bletchley Park was back in 2008. Tickets were just a few pounds then, and I still remember seeing the Colossus machine rebuilt and working fine. Ever since, TNMOC has been inseparable from my visits to Bletchley Park—no trip ever felt complete without stepping into those rooms filled with the hum of history.</p>\n<p>There’s a personal thread here too. My parents and sister once stood in the middle of the World War II experience at Bletchley, a powerful reminder of how computing and codebreaking shaped the course of history. Later, during my time at Elastacloud, I visited the museum many times—sometimes for executive meetings, sometimes simply out of that enduring geeky connection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"back-to-my-roots-in-electronics\">Back to My Roots in Electronics</h2>\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/873e0195c2.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n<p>But this visit was different. More personal. More nostalgic.</p>\n<p>As a boy growing up in Bangalore, I attended an electronics course at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visvesvaraya_Industrial_and_Technological_Museum\">Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technological Museum.</a> That’s where my fascination with circuits began, long before computers took over my imagination. I would cycle 15 km to a small workshops on Tank Bund Road and TCM Royan Road (running parallel to Majestic Railway Station Platforms and Depot) where they had a lathe machine to drill holes into copper boards, carefully etch circuits with marker pens, and dip the boards into acid to bring them to life.</p>\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/47074db4d8.png\" alt=\"\">\n<p>Components like LEDs, diodes, and ICs were bought from another shop nearly 10 km away (Seppings Road, Shivajinagar).</p>\n<p>At home, I somehow convinced my father to buy me a soldering iron and some flux. The first circuit I ever built was a doorbell that played Christmas carols. I still remember the thrill—it felt like I was on top of the world.</p>\n<p>That passion carried me to my first ever science exhibition at Christ School, where I built a model train set with an automated railway crossing using photo diodes. It wasn’t just about the project—it gave me confidence, and yes, it even introduced me to my first crush!</p>\n<p>So, when I sat with a soldering kit again at TNMOC, it wasn’t just about building an RC2014 computer—it was like rediscovering a part of myself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-shared-learning-with-my-daughter\">A Shared Learning with My Daughter</h2>\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/8ff09e6d2d.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n<p>What made it even more special was sharing the day with my daughter.

				"content_text": "<img src=\"uploads/2025/9c1cf9476e.png\" alt=\"\">\n\n_From Bangalore’s hand-etched circuits to RC2014 kits — a journey rewired_\n\nOn the 20th of September 2025, my daughter and I spent a day at the National Museum of Computing ([TNMOC](http://www.tnmoc.org/)) in Bletchley Park for the [RC2014 ](https://rc2014.co.uk/) assembly [event](https://rc2014.co.uk/3855/rc2014-assembly-v1-0/). It was, without exaggeration, one of the most special visits I’ve ever made to the museum—and I’ve been there countless times.\n\n## A Place That Never Loses Its Charm\n\nMy first visit to Bletchley Park was back in 2008. Tickets were just a few pounds then, and I still remember seeing the Colossus machine rebuilt and working fine. Ever since, TNMOC has been inseparable from my visits to Bletchley Park—no trip ever felt complete without stepping into those rooms filled with the hum of history.\n\nThere’s a personal thread here too. My parents and sister once stood in the middle of the World War II experience at Bletchley, a powerful reminder of how computing and codebreaking shaped the course of history. Later, during my time at Elastacloud, I visited the museum many times—sometimes for executive meetings, sometimes simply out of that enduring geeky connection.\n\n## Back to My Roots in Electronics\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/873e0195c2.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n\n<!--more-->\n\nBut this visit was different. More personal. More nostalgic.\n\nAs a boy growing up in Bangalore, I attended an electronics course at the [Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technological Museum.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visvesvaraya_Industrial_and_Technological_Museum) That’s where my fascination with circuits began, long before computers took over my imagination. I would cycle 15 km to a small workshops on Tank Bund Road and TCM Royan Road (running parallel to Majestic Railway Station Platforms and Depot) where they had a lathe machine to drill holes into copper boards, carefully etch circuits with marker pens, and dip the boards into acid to bring them to life. \n\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/47074db4d8.png\" alt=\"\">\n\nComponents like LEDs, diodes, and ICs were bought from another shop nearly 10 km away (Seppings Road, Shivajinagar).\n\nAt home, I somehow convinced my father to buy me a soldering iron and some flux. The first circuit I ever built was a doorbell that played Christmas carols. I still remember the thrill—it felt like I was on top of the world.\n\nThat passion carried me to my first ever science exhibition at Christ School, where I built a model train set with an automated railway crossing using photo diodes. It wasn’t just about the project—it gave me confidence, and yes, it even introduced me to my first crush!\n\nSo, when I sat with a soldering kit again at TNMOC, it wasn’t just about building an RC2014 computer—it was like rediscovering a part of myself.\n\n## A Shared Learning with My Daughter\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/8ff09e6d2d.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n\nWhat made it even more special was sharing the day with my daughter. Watching her see the fundamentals of computing for the first time—registers, RAM, and machine instructions—was priceless.\n\nSteve, one of the guides, demonstrated how to load bits into registers, and I could see her mind racing. Just a week ago she was complaining about her i5 laptop with 16 GB RAM slowing down, and now she was marveling at what people managed to do with a mere 32K RAM. That kind of perspective shift is worth a thousand lectures.\n\nI bought an RC2014 kit and a few extra modules, partly for myself and partly so we could build something together—assembly, BASIC, the works.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/2fe8734cfa.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n\n## Serendipity and Old Friendships\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/9df0c1b5a9.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n\nAnd then, as if the day hadn’t already been special enough, I ran into an old colleague and friend. He had traveled all the way from the south coast of England—three hours just to attend the same event. The last time we’d met was in 2009.\n\nWe reminisced about the days when we used to head to the office daily, and he shared how he now enjoys working fully remote. I, in turn, shared the wild rollercoaster of my last eight years. Standing there among the exhibits, it felt like no time had passed at all.\n\n## Why This Visit Was Different\n\nFor me, this visit wasn’t just about computers or soldering irons. It was about bridging past and present:\n* The boy in Bangalore, cycling miles for electronic parts.\n* The father, sharing a spark of fascination with his daughter.\n* The professional, reconnecting with an old friend after more than a decade.\n\nThe RC2014 event tied all these threads together—nostalgia, learning, and friendship—making it the most meaningful visit I’ve ever had to TNMOC.\n",

He wanted to support a young man’s further education — someone from a small town in South India — but there was a twist. This young person had a Bachelor’s degree in Commerce but was now insistent that his future lay in IT.</p>\n<p>My friend was unconvinced. And honestly, I was equally puzzled.</p>\n<p>We decided to speak with the young man over a video call to understand what drove this sudden pivot. The call didn’t offer much clarity. All we got was a strong sense of his “passion” for IT — but not much depth on why he felt this way. There was no clear articulation of what aspect of IT excited him, no tangible examples, and no signs of experience or experimentation.</p>\n<p>Luckily, a few days later, my friend got the opportunity to meet him in person in Bangalore. When I also happened to be in Bangalore the following week, we compared notes.

He wanted to support a young man’s further education — someone from a small town in South India — but there was a twist. This young person had a Bachelor’s degree in Commerce but was now insistent that his future lay in IT.\n\nMy friend was unconvinced. And honestly, I was equally puzzled.\n\nWe decided to speak with the young man over a video call to understand what drove this sudden pivot. The call didn’t offer much clarity. All we got was a strong sense of his “passion” for IT — but not much depth on why he felt this way. There was no clear articulation of what aspect of IT excited him, no tangible examples, and no signs of experience or experimentation.\n\nLuckily, a few days later, my friend got the opportunity to meet him in person in Bangalore. When I also happened to be in Bangalore the following week, we compared notes. My friend’s impression hadn’t changed much — he still felt the young man was directionless and was wasting his solid foundation in commerce.

				"content_html": "<img src=\"uploads/2025/586e1b047e.png\" alt=\"\">\n<p>In my career, I’ve had the rare opportunity to experience two vastly different types of leadership. They’ve left such a deep impression that I now see them not just as management styles, but as philosophies of life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"picture-this\">Picture this.</h2>\n<p><strong>One type of leader treats the workplace like a race.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Win fast. Win hard. Win at all costs.</li>\n<li>Efficiency is everything. Drive the team like an engine on max throttle—results over relationships.</li>\n<li>It’s about hierarchy, competition, and stories of lone heroes rising above the rest.</li>\n<li>There’s praise, yes—but it&rsquo;s often delivered by contrasting one teammate as “brilliant” by calling another “not good enough.” The goal? Inspire through comparison. Motivate through fear of inadequacy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The other treats work like a marathon.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pacing matters. Shared progress. Winning <em>together</em>.</li>\n<li>Effectiveness over frenzy. Use the car only when needed—not just because we paid for it.</li>\n<li>Here, growth isn’t measured just in revenue or headcount, but in how much people <em>actually want to come to work</em>.</li>\n<li>There are no whispered stories of who&rsquo;s underperforming. Instead, leaders work hard to make everyone’s strengths visible and valued.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>In the race world:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You’re trained to outsmart, outshine, outperform—even deceive.</li>\n<li>Respect is conditional. Trust is transactional.</li>\n<li>Leadership is about control, comparison, and closing deals fast.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>In the marathon world:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You’re guided to be truthful, collaborative, and proud of collective wins.</li>\n<li>Respect is mutual. Trust is foundational.</li>\n<li>Leadership is about care, character, and continuous growth.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"a-moment-from-the-marathon\">A Moment From the Marathon</h3>\n<p>I once saw the early signs of this “race” mindset taking root—right in a team I had helped build.</p>\n<p>Back in the early days of the offshore team I was helping scale up, a group of three began subtly vying for influence. Rather than collaborating they started escalating issues directly to me, bypassing the person right next to them. It was an early warning sign—one that reminded me just how quickly hierarchy and competition can sneak in.</p>\n<p>At our next monthly company-wide meeting, I brought it up—not as a scolding, but as a reset. I clarified that there was no pecking order. That line managers existed only for operational efficiency—not as symbols of rank, authority, or value.</p>\n<p>What happened next was quietly powerful. A new sense of camaraderie formed. People opened up more, leaned on each other, and worked as a unit again. It felt like we were back on the marathon track. A horizontal hierarchy was established.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, wider organizational dynamics eventually pulled us back into a more traditional vertical hierarchy. The culture shifted, and with it came the usual symptoms—guardedness, mistrust, and subtle internal competition.</p>\n<p>But that brief period remains a reminder: when leadership makes space for equality, people naturally move toward connection—not comparison.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>One type of leader rewards clever deception and praises the ability to “play the game.”</strong>\nThe other promotes honesty, mutual respect, and morals over manipulation.</p>\n<p><strong>One builds walls of hierarchy.</strong>\nThe other builds bridges across roles.</p>\n<p><strong>One talks about money as the final prize, the endpoint.</strong>\nThe other treats meaningful work as a lifelong journey worth continuing—even without a finish line.</p>\n<p>The first type gets things done. But often at the cost of joy, trust, and personal dignity or a contrived version of these qualities that is imposed in a manipulative way.\nThe second type? They might move slower. They might not scale teams to giant sizes or show dramatic profit spikes overnight. But they create something that lasts: a culture of happiness, of togetherness, of shared purpose.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, I’ve come to believe that these leadership instincts aren’t just personal—they&rsquo;re cultural.\nThe first kind of leader I worked with was shaped by a world that prizes competition, individualism, and high-stakes performance—traits often emphasized in Western corporate environments. The second came from a background steeped in Eastern philosophies, where cooperation, inner balance, and mutual respect are often held in higher regard. For him, leading like a marathon runner came naturally.</p>\n<p>The strange thing is, many people I know still believe the first kind is “how leadership works.” But it doesn’t have to be. It’s not just about what kind of leader you are. It’s also about what kind of leadership you choose to accept around you.</p>\n<p><em>Not every team needs to be a race team.\nNot every finish line is worth the sprint.</em></p>\n<p>The kind of leadership we accept—or enable—shapes more than our output. It shapes how we feel about ourselves, our work, and each other.</p>\n<p><em>So, ready to choose the leader you&rsquo;d like to become yourself? The world is full of wonderful people.

They’ve left such a deep impression that I now see them not just as management styles, but as philosophies of life.\n\nPicture this.\n---\n**One type of leader treats the workplace like a race.**\n* Win fast. Win hard. Win at all costs.\n* Efficiency is everything. Drive the team like an engine on max throttle—results over relationships. \n* It’s about hierarchy, competition, and stories of lone heroes rising above the rest.\n* There’s praise, yes—but it's often delivered by contrasting one teammate as “brilliant” by calling another “not good enough.” The goal? Inspire through comparison. Motivate through fear of inadequacy.\n\n**The other treats work like a marathon.**\n* Pacing matters. Shared progress. Winning *together*.\n* Effectiveness over frenzy. Use the car only when needed—not just because we paid for it.\n* Here, growth isn’t measured just in revenue or headcount, but in how much people *actually want to come to work*.\n* There are no whispered stories of who's underperforming. Instead, leaders work hard to make everyone’s strengths visible and valued.\n\n<!--more-->\n---\n\n**In the race world:**\n\n* You’re trained to outsmart, outshine, outperform—even deceive.\n* Respect is conditional. Trust is transactional.\n* Leadership is about control, comparison, and closing deals fast.\n\n**In the marathon world:**\n\n* You’re guided to be truthful, collaborative, and proud of collective wins.\n* Respect is mutual. Trust is foundational.\n* Leadership is about care, character, and continuous growth.\n\n---\n\n### A Moment From the Marathon\n\nI once saw the early signs of this “race” mindset taking root—right in a team I had helped build.\n\nBack in the early days of the offshore team I was helping scale up, a group of three began subtly vying for influence. Rather than collaborating they started escalating issues directly to me, bypassing the person right next to them. It was an early warning sign—one that reminded me just how quickly hierarchy and competition can sneak in.\n\nAt our next monthly company-wide meeting, I brought it up—not as a scolding, but as a reset. I clarified that there was no pecking order. That line managers existed only for operational efficiency—not as symbols of rank, authority, or value.\n\nWhat happened next was quietly powerful. A new sense of camaraderie formed. People opened up more, leaned on each other, and worked as a unit again. It felt like we were back on the marathon track. A horizontal hierarchy was established.\n\nUnfortunately, wider organizational dynamics eventually pulled us back into a more traditional vertical hierarchy. The culture shifted, and with it came the usual symptoms—guardedness, mistrust, and subtle internal competition.\n\nBut that brief period remains a reminder: when leadership makes space for equality, people naturally move toward connection—not comparison.\n\n---\n\n**One type of leader rewards clever deception and praises the ability to “play the game.”**\nThe other promotes honesty, mutual respect, and morals over manipulation.\n\n**One builds walls of hierarchy.**\nThe other builds bridges across roles.\n\n**One talks about money as the final prize, the endpoint.**\nThe other treats meaningful work as a lifelong journey worth continuing—even without a finish line.\n\nThe first type gets things done. But often at the cost of joy, trust, and personal dignity or a contrived version of these qualities that is imposed in a manipulative way.\nThe second type? They might move slower. They might not scale teams to giant sizes or show dramatic profit spikes overnight. But they create something that lasts: a culture of happiness, of togetherness, of shared purpose.\n\nInterestingly, I’ve come to believe that these leadership instincts aren’t just personal—they're cultural.\nThe first kind of leader I worked with was shaped by a world that prizes competition, individualism, and high-stakes performance—traits often emphasized in Western corporate environments. The second came from a background steeped in Eastern philosophies, where cooperation, inner balance, and mutual respect are often held in higher regard. For him, leading like a marathon runner came naturally.\n\nThe strange thing is, many people I know still believe the first kind is “how leadership works.” But it doesn’t have to be. It’s not just about what kind of leader you are. It’s also about what kind of leadership you choose to accept around you.\n\n*Not every team needs to be a race team.\nNot every finish line is worth the sprint.*\n\nThe kind of leadership we accept—or enable—shapes more than our output. It shapes how we feel about ourselves, our work, and each other.\n\n*So, ready to choose the leader you'd like to become yourself? The world is full of wonderful people. Start finding your type, now.*\n",

They chased £5B revenue with aggressive accounting and overexpansion, racking up £1.5B debt. When projects stalled? Bankruptcy. Poof.[[1](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42731762)]  \n- **Premature scaling kills agility**. A solo consultant spending £3k/month on a “marketing team” before securing clients?

				"content_html": "<h3>The following are the detailed steps to use Ninject IoC with ASP.NET MVC</h3>\n<h5>Download and install TortoiseSVN</h5>\n<a href=\"http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/\" target=\"_blank\">TortoiseSVN</a> is a Subversion client that allows you to manage source control tasks from within Windows Explorer.\n<h5>Download the source code for <a href=\"http://ninject.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Ninject</a> from google code</h5>\nThe Ninject source code is hosted in Google Code website. To download the code to PC, we will use TortoiseSVN. Before that we need the URL of the repository. This is available in the following url:\n<p><a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/ninject/source/checkout\"><a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/ninject/source/checkout\">http://code.google.com/p/ninject/source/checkout</a></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja1.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"Ninja1\" alt=\"Ninja1\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja1_thumb.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"330\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>Then using Windows Explorer use the “Export” option of TortoiseSVN to get a copy of the source code as shown in the figures below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja2.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"Ninja2\" alt=\"Ninja2\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja2_thumb.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"464\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja3.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"Ninja3\" alt=\"Ninja3\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja3_thumb.png\" width=\"549\" height=\"447\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja4.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"Ninja4\" alt=\"Ninja4\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja4_thumb.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"269\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<h5>Build the Ninject source code</h5>\nOnce we have the source code, we need to build it to generate the two assemblies we need.\n<p>We will run the Build.cmd file that will trigger a Nant build script which will eventually build the entire source.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja5.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"Ninja5\" alt=\"Ninja5\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja5_thumb.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"259\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>Once we have built the source code successfully, we can find the two assemblies we need in the /bin/debug folder as shown below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja6.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"Ninja6\" alt=\"Ninja6\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja6_thumb.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"483\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<h5>Create a new MVC project</h5>\nNow, let us create a new MVC project using Visual Studio 2008.\n<p><a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/mvc1.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"MVC1\" alt=\"MVC1\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/mvc1_thumb.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"455\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/mvc2.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"MVC2\" alt=\"MVC2\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/mvc2_thumb.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"428\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/mvc3.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"MVC3\" alt=\"MVC3\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/mvc3_thumb.png\" width=\"335\" height=\"582\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>Let us test if all is fine by running the application</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/mvc4.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"MVC4\" alt=\"MVC4\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/mvc4_thumb.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"398\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<h5>Making the MVC project a meaningful project</h5>\nBefore jumping into adding references to the Ninject assemblies, let us modify this MVC project to do something useful.\n<p>We are going to create an application that will help us browse through the bills in a Parliament. The Parliament has two chambers. House of Lords and House of Commons and each have their own bills at anytime which they are legislating about.</p>\n<p>I am going to show only the code relevant to this topic, so will not show in detail all the steps in creating this. The source code for this can be downloaded to view the complete implementation minus Ninject integration. Some screen shots of the application is shown below:</p>\n<h6>Home Page</h6>\n<a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/parl1.png\"><img

This is where Ninject comes in.\n<h5>Integrating Ninject for Constructor Injection</h5>\nThe BillController depends on an appropriate instance of IDataRepository to be passed when it’s constructed using the constructor. By default, MVC Framework creates an instance of BillController by using a parameterless constructor. In our case, we have want MVC to call our constructor with IDataRepository parameter and pass in the correct instance that we will configure.\n<p>To instruct the MVC framework to do this, we have to modify the Global.asax.cs. The default Global.asax.cs file is as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\" id=\"scid:9ce6104f-a9aa-4a17-a79f-3a39532ebf7c:57b92842-bf7d-4c93-a481-ee4b6534df1c\"

two references to our project. Before that let us copy the two assemblies we need to a “lib” folder inside our Visual Studio solution folder:\n<p><a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja61.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"Ninja6\" alt=\"Ninja6\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja6_thumb1.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"483\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja7.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"Ninja7\" alt=\"Ninja7\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja7_thumb.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"157\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>Let us then add the references:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja8.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"Ninja8\" alt=\"Ninja8\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja8_thumb.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"449\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>Upon adding the reference, the NinjectHttpApplication requires us to implement two Abstract members</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>CreateKernel()</li>\n\t<li>RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection)</li>\n</ol>\nThe CreateKernel is where we tell Ninject which Concrete Class needs to be injected when the Constructor of BillController is called.\n<p>The RegisterRoutes is where we configure the MVC Routing options.</p>\n<p>We need to do two things now:</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Ensure the

This is available in the following url:\n\n<a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/ninject/source/checkout\">http://code.google.com/p/ninject/source/checkout</a>\n<!--more-->\n<a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja1.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"Ninja1\" alt=\"Ninja1\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja1_thumb.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"330\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\nThen using Windows Explorer use the “Export” option of TortoiseSVN to get a copy of the source code as shown in the figures below:\n\n<a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja2.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"Ninja2\" alt=\"Ninja2\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja2_thumb.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"464\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja3.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"Ninja3\" alt=\"Ninja3\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja3_thumb.png\" width=\"549\" height=\"447\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja4.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"Ninja4\" alt=\"Ninja4\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja4_thumb.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"269\" border=\"0\"></a>\n<h5>Build the Ninject source code</h5>\nOnce we have the source code, we need to build it to generate the two assemblies we need.\n\nWe will run the Build.cmd file that will trigger a Nant build script which will eventually build the entire source.\n\n<a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja5.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"Ninja5\" alt=\"Ninja5\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja5_thumb.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"259\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\nOnce we have built the source code successfully, we can find the two assemblies we need in the /bin/debug folder as shown below:\n\n<a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja6.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"Ninja6\" alt=\"Ninja6\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja6_thumb.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"483\" border=\"0\"></a>\n<h5>Create a new MVC project</h5>\nNow, let us create a new MVC project using Visual Studio 2008.\n\n<a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/mvc1.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"MVC1\" alt=\"MVC1\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/mvc1_thumb.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"455\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/mvc2.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"MVC2\" alt=\"MVC2\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/mvc2_thumb.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"428\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/mvc3.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"MVC3\" alt=\"MVC3\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/mvc3_thumb.png\" width=\"335\" height=\"582\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\nLet us test if all is fine by running the application\n\n<a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/mvc4.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"MVC4\" alt=\"MVC4\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/mvc4_thumb.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"398\" border=\"0\"></a>\n<h5>Making the MVC project a meaningful project</h5>\nBefore jumping into adding references to the Ninject assemblies, let us modify this MVC project to do something useful.\n\nWe are going to create an application that will help us browse through the bills in a Parliament. The Parliament has two chambers. House of Lords and House of Commons and each have their own bills at anytime which they are legislating about.\n\nI am going to show only the code relevant to this topic, so will not show in detail all the steps in creating this. The source code for this can be downloaded to view the complete implementation minus Ninject integration. Some screen shots of the application is shown below:\n<h6>Home Page</h6>\n<a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/parl1.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\"

This is where Ninject comes in.\n<h5>Integrating Ninject for Constructor Injection</h5>\nThe BillController depends on an appropriate instance of IDataRepository to be passed when it’s constructed using the constructor. By default, MVC Framework creates an instance of BillController by using a parameterless constructor. In our case, we have want MVC to call our constructor with IDataRepository parameter and pass in the correct instance that we will configure.\n\nTo instruct the MVC framework to do this, we have to modify the Global.asax.cs. The default Global.asax.cs file is as follows:\n<div class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\" id=\"scid:9ce6104f-a9aa-4a17-a79f-3a39532ebf7c:57b92842-bf7d-4c93-a481-ee4b6534df1c\"

two references to our project. Before that let us copy the two assemblies we need to a “lib” folder inside our Visual Studio solution folder:\n\n<a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja61.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"Ninja6\" alt=\"Ninja6\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja6_thumb1.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"483\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja7.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"Ninja7\" alt=\"Ninja7\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja7_thumb.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"157\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\nLet us then add the references:\n\n<a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja8.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"Ninja8\" alt=\"Ninja8\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja8_thumb.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"449\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\nUpon adding the reference, the NinjectHttpApplication requires us to implement two Abstract members\n<ol>\n\t<li>CreateKernel()</li>\n\t<li>RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection)</li>\n</ol>\nThe CreateKernel is where we tell Ninject which Concrete Class needs to be injected when the Constructor of BillController is called.\n\nThe RegisterRoutes is where we configure the MVC Routing options.\n\nWe need to do two things now:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Ensure the Routing still works (because the Application_Start() is now moved into NinjectHttpApplication and RegisterRoutes is also made abstract in NinjectHttpApplication)</li>\n\t<li>Create a configuration that tells Ninject to

In my previous projects, I’ve never overlooked the Use Case Analysis and has thus resulted in completing the projects on time and to the stakeholder’s satisfaction.\n<p>I have, in the past, effectively communicated my understanding of “&ldquo;WHAT” needs to be done in the project by providing a <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/powerpoint/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">PowerPoint</a> presentation.

				"title": "Tapovanam - application design and architecture",
				"content_html": "<p>In redesigning and redeveloping Tapovanam's (my friend's organisation) web site, I want to put in place a good architecture. The following are some of the considerations:</p> <ul> <li>A multi-tier design (mainly to separate presentation code from business logic)  </li>\n<li>Support themes in presentation layer to switch designs easily at later stage.  </li>\n<li>Object oriented business logic layer (BLL) (with business objects)  </li>\n<li>Data access layer (DAL) to be independent of underlying database (to switch databases or even use XML files as data store at a later time)  </li>\n<li>Data Transfer Objects (DTO) to pass data between BLL and DAL  </li>\n<li>Maximum use of Data Binding at the presentation layer </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Following are few ideas in mind at this moment to solve the above problems:</p> <p><u>Multi-tier Design</u></p> <p>Presentation Layer - ASP.NET Web Forms</p> <p>Business Logic Layer - C# business objects having all the validation logic and an abstracted view of underlying data schema.</p> <p>Data Access Layer - C# data access classes to retrieve and store data in data transfer objects</p> <p><u>Plug-in model for Data Access</u></p> <p>To be able to change or use multiple data stores with least effort, the Data Access Layer will use the Provider Model design pattern. </p> <p>An <em>abstract base</em> class containing common data access methods like ExecuteNonQuery, ExecuteReader will be used. This methods in this <em>abstract base</em> class serve as Helper methods for data access. (similar to Data Access Application Block in Enterprise Library). This could be named as <strong>DataAccess</strong></p> <p>For each module in the web site (Eg.. Photos, Events, Commentaries), an <em>abstract provider</em> class and a <em>concrete</em> class is created. </p> <p>The <em>abstract provider</em> class will have abstract CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) methods which will be implemented by the <em>concrete</em> class. For example, GetPhoto(), GetPhotosByCategory() etc. This class is data store agnostic. This could be named as <strong>PhotoProvider</strong></p> <p>The <em>concrete</em> class will have the data store specific method implementations defined in the <em>abstract provider</em>. This could be named as <strong>SqlPhotoProvider</strong></p> <p><u>Data Transfer Object</u></p> <p>To transfer objects with data between BLL and DAL, separate classes are created.

				"content_text": "<p>In redesigning and redeveloping Tapovanam's (my friend's organisation) web site, I want to put in place a good architecture. The following are some of the considerations:</p> <ul> <li>A multi-tier design (mainly to separate presentation code from business logic)  </li>\n<li>Support themes in presentation layer to switch designs easily at later stage.  </li>\n<li>Object oriented business logic layer (BLL) (with business objects)  </li>\n<li>Data access layer (DAL) to be independent of underlying database (to switch databases or even use XML files as data store at a later time)  </li>\n<li>Data Transfer Objects (DTO) to pass data between BLL and DAL  </li>\n<li>Maximum use of Data Binding at the presentation layer </li>\n</ul>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>Following are few ideas in mind at this moment to solve the above problems:</p> <p><u>Multi-tier Design</u></p> <p>Presentation Layer - ASP.NET Web Forms</p> <p>Business Logic Layer - C# business objects having all the validation logic and an abstracted view of underlying data schema.</p> <p>Data Access Layer - C# data access classes to retrieve and store data in data transfer objects</p> <p><u>Plug-in model for Data Access</u></p> <p>To be able to change or use multiple data stores with least effort, the Data Access Layer will use the Provider Model design pattern. </p> <p>An <em>abstract base</em> class containing common data access methods like ExecuteNonQuery, ExecuteReader will be used. This methods in this <em>abstract base</em> class serve as Helper methods for data access. (similar to Data Access Application Block in Enterprise Library). This could be named as <strong>DataAccess</strong></p> <p>For each module in the web site (Eg.. Photos, Events, Commentaries), an <em>abstract provider</em> class and a <em>concrete</em> class is created. </p> <p>The <em>abstract provider</em> class will have abstract CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) methods which will be implemented by the <em>concrete</em> class. For example, GetPhoto(), GetPhotosByCategory() etc. This class is data store agnostic. This could be named as <strong>PhotoProvider</strong></p> <p>The <em>concrete</em> class will have the data store specific method implementations defined in the <em>abstract provider</em>. This could be named as <strong>SqlPhotoProvider</strong></p> <p><u>Data Transfer Object</u></p> <p>To transfer objects with data between BLL and DAL, separate classes are created. For example, <em>PhotoDetails</em> class to store the Photo record obtained from data store.

				"content_html": "<p>Finally I got a chance to use these tools (<a href=\"http://nant.sourceforge.net/\">NAnt</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nunit.org/\">NUnit</a>)</p>\n<p>The first to be used was NUnit 2.2 and had problems using it because I don&rsquo;t have permissions to install any assemblies into the .NET 1.1 Global Assembly Cache. So, I had to obtain the source and did the manual installation of copying all the required assemblies into a single folder. Then I set up the Path Environment variable to include path where these assemblies were put.</p>\n<p>After doing this I went cruising my way creating cool unit tests for my own library under construction. It all worked fine and I used the NUnit-GUI to test my applications.</p>\n<p>Then came the second half of the fun! I had to now use the NAnt build tool. So, went ahead and downloaded the binaries for NAnt. As done earlier, set up the environment variable path. I was lazy and tried to use the build of my VS.NET projects using the task. Boom! A enormous list of errors and exception finally thrown at me by the NAnt utility.

				"content_text": "Finally I got a chance to use these tools (<a href=\"http://nant.sourceforge.net/\">NAnt</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nunit.org/\">NUnit</a>)\n\nThe first to be used was NUnit 2.2 and had problems using it because I don't have permissions to install any assemblies into the .NET 1.1 Global Assembly Cache. So, I had to obtain the source and did the manual installation of copying all the required assemblies into a single folder. Then I set up the Path Environment variable to include path where these assemblies were put.\n\nAfter doing this I went cruising my way creating cool unit tests for my own library under construction. It all worked fine and I used the NUnit-GUI to test my applications.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThen came the second half of the fun! I had to now use the NAnt build tool. So, went ahead and downloaded the binaries for NAnt. As done earlier, set up the environment variable path. I was lazy and tried to use the build of my VS.NET projects using the task. Boom! A enormous list of errors and exception finally thrown at me by the NAnt utility. Now, I did not want to use the <a href=\"http://nant.sourceforge.net/help/tasks/\">task</a> and went ahead to create my own directory structure (deciding where each output should go into and also keeping in mind the NUnit tests to be run automatically by NAnt) and corresponding task in my build.xml file.\n\nThe most frustrating or shameful mistake I did was to forget the fact that xml tagging is case sensitive.
