				"content_html": "<p>This week, I had the pleasure of attending perhaps one of the most delightful wedding receptions I&rsquo;ve experienced in years. As I reflect on this during my flight back to London, I&rsquo;m struck by how the entire event embodied what we in the corporate world call the KISS principle: Keep It Simple, Stupid.

				"content_text": "My friend wanted to get started with using <a href=\"http://foundation.zurb.com/\">Foundation</a> for an upcoming Greenfield project. The trouble is Foundation comes in two flavours:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Foundation3 with default CSS</li>\n\t<li>Foundation3 with <a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\">SCSS</a> (Sassy CSS, which is the syntax used by SASS ‚Äì \"Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets\". SASS is an extension of CSS3 which brings familiar programming concepts to CSS like variables, nesting of selectors, functions aka mixins)</li>\n</ul>\nWhile \"Foundation3 with default CSS\" can be perfectly used to take advantage of Foundation's amazing <a href=\"http://foundation.zurb.com/grid.php\">features</a>, using \"Foundation3 with SCSS\" was thought of a natural way to learn and build websites with SCSS. But, the problem is \"Foundation3 with SCSS\" does not come as an executable installer for Windows. It is packaged with a CSS Authoring Framework called \"<a href=\"http://compass-style.org/\">Compass</a>\". For a start, Compass contains re-usable cross-browse CSS mixins, which in itself is a good utility. There are other <a href=\"http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/\">advantages</a> in using Compass too.\n\nThe Compass framework does not have a Windows Installer. It is only available as a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems\">Ruby Gem</a> package, which means we have to install <a href=\"http://rubyinstaller.org/\">Ruby for Windows</a> first.

the correct IDataRepository instance to the BillController. This is where Ninject comes in.\n<h5>Integrating Ninject for Constructor Injection</h5>\nThe BillController depends on an appropriate instance of IDataRepository to be passed when it‚Äôs constructed using the constructor. By default, MVC Framework creates an instance of BillController by using a parameterless constructor. In our case, we have want MVC to call our constructor with IDataRepository parameter and pass in the correct instance that we will configure.\n\nTo instruct the MVC framework to do this, we have to modify the Global.asax.cs. The default Global.asax.cs file is as follows:\n<div class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\" id=\"scid:9ce6104f-a9aa-4a17-a79f-3a39532ebf7c:57b92842-bf7d-4c93-a481-ee4b6534df1c\"

two references to our project. Before that let us copy the two assemblies we need to a ‚Äúlib‚Äù folder inside our Visual Studio solution folder:\n\n<a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja61.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"Ninja6\" alt=\"Ninja6\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja6_thumb1.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"483\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja7.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"Ninja7\" alt=\"Ninja7\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja7_thumb.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"157\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\nLet us then add the references:\n\n<a href=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja8.png\"><img style=\"display:inline;border-width:0;\" title=\"Ninja8\" alt=\"Ninja8\" src=\"http://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ninja8_thumb.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"449\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\nUpon adding the reference, the NinjectHttpApplication requires us to implement two Abstract members\n<ol>\n\t<li>CreateKernel()</li>\n\t<li>RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection)</li>\n</ol>\nThe CreateKernel is where we tell Ninject which Concrete Class needs to be injected when the Constructor of BillController is called.\n\nThe RegisterRoutes is where we configure the MVC Routing options.\n\nWe need to do two things now:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Ensure the Routing still works (because the Application_Start() is now moved into NinjectHttpApplication and RegisterRoutes is also made abstract in NinjectHttpApplication)</li>\n\t<li>Create a configuration that tells Ninject to inject FakeDepository whenever IDataRepository is requested.</li>\n</ol>\nFirst, change the RegisterRoutes from being a private method to an overridden protected method¬† as shown below:\n<div

I can‚Äôt wait for the book to be released.\n\nThe most impressive of this <a href=\"http://www.dynamic-prototyping.com/071009_Dynamic_Prototyping.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">sample chapter</a> is that it covers almost many basic things that as a developer I would need to get started with SketchFlow. Here is a gist:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Understanding Blend 3 workspace for SketchFlow</li>\n\t<li>Working with SketchFlow Map</li>\n\t<li>Importing freehand drawings and creating own content</li>\n\t<li>Sharing Sketches and getting Feedback (this one rocks!)</li>\n\t<li>Animation</li>\n\t<li>Navigation</li>\n\t<li>States</li>\n\t<li>Sampling Data</li>\n\t<li>Components</li>\n\t<li>Annotations</li>\n\t<li>Creating Documentation of the SketchFlow</li>\n</ol>\nAfter having completed this sample chapter, I am confident of now creating sketches to show to my new project‚Äôs stakeholder. Hopefully, I won‚Äôt meet him because the SketchFlow Player (which is essentially a <a href=\"http://silverlight.net/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Silverlight</a> application) enables all possible basic scenarios to obtain feedback from the stakeholder while working remotely. Once I publish my sketchflow in a secure location online for my stakeholder to view, then begins the impressive process of refining requirements and use cases.\n\nThe step after that would be to create User Stories for the minimal Scrum based project management tool <a href=\"http://scrumy.com\" target=\"_blank\">Scrumy</a>.\n\nThen with the great online repository of <a href=\"http://www.unfuddle.com\" target=\"_blank\">Unfuddle</a>, I should be unfuddling in no time at all to implement the project.\n\nExpecting an exciting August month.\n\n<img src=\"https://peakbyte.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/expression_blend_f005d908-0287-4a20-95cd-8ff0968205a2.jpg\"> \n",

				"content_text": "<p>In redesigning and redeveloping Tapovanam's (my friend's organisation) web site, I want to put in place a good architecture. The following are some of the considerations:</p> <ul> <li>A multi-tier design (mainly to separate presentation code from business logic)  </li>\n<li>Support themes in presentation layer to switch designs easily at later stage.  </li>\n<li>Object oriented business logic layer (BLL) (with business objects)  </li>\n<li>Data access layer (DAL) to be independent of underlying database (to switch databases or even use XML files as data store at a later time)  </li>\n<li>Data Transfer Objects (DTO) to pass data between BLL and DAL  </li>\n<li>Maximum use of Data Binding at the presentation layer </li>\n</ul>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>Following are few ideas in mind at this moment to solve the above problems:</p> <p><u>Multi-tier Design</u></p> <p>Presentation Layer - ASP.NET Web Forms</p> <p>Business Logic Layer - C# business objects having all the validation logic and an abstracted view of underlying data schema.</p> <p>Data Access Layer - C# data access classes to retrieve and store data in data transfer objects</p> <p><u>Plug-in model for Data Access</u></p> <p>To be able to change or use multiple data stores with least effort, the Data Access Layer will use the Provider Model design pattern. </p> <p>An <em>abstract base</em> class containing common data access methods like ExecuteNonQuery, ExecuteReader will be used. This methods in this <em>abstract base</em> class serve as Helper methods for data access. (similar to Data Access Application Block in Enterprise Library). This could be named as <strong>DataAccess</strong></p> <p>For each module in the web site (Eg.. Photos, Events, Commentaries), an <em>abstract provider</em> class and a <em>concrete</em> class is created. </p> <p>The <em>abstract provider</em> class will have abstract CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) methods which will be implemented by the <em>concrete</em> class. For example, GetPhoto(), GetPhotosByCategory() etc. This class is data store agnostic. This could be named as <strong>PhotoProvider</strong></p> <p>The <em>concrete</em> class will have the data store specific method implementations defined in the <em>abstract provider</em>. This could be named as <strong>SqlPhotoProvider</strong></p> <p><u>Data Transfer Object</u></p> <p>To transfer objects with data between BLL and DAL, separate classes are created. For example, <em>PhotoDetails</em> class to store the Photo record obtained from data store. Using un-typed DataSets as DTOs is problematic when it comes to maintenance (spelling mistakes are a pain)</p> <p>A collection (like List<T>) of DTOs is used to pass a set of retrieved data from data store to BLL.</p> <p><u>Object Oriented BLL</u></p> <p>The business logic layer consists of C# classes that represent the business objects. These classes have all the validation logic, business logic and methods that talk to the DAL. These classes also use the respective Data Transfer Objects to pass and retrieve data from DAL. These classes can be named like <em>Photo</em>, <em>Event </em>etc.</p> <p><u>DataBinding in Presentation Layer</u></p> <p>To databind UI components like ListView, GridView, DetailsView etc. the ObjectDataSource controls are used in the aspx pages. The ObjectDataSource controls use the Business Objects in BLL and facilitate as binding adapters between the aspx page and business objects.</p> <p>Other considerations include :</p> <ul> <li>Using all the existing ASP.NET built-in <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479030.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Provider</a> services like Membership, Profile, Health Monitoring and Personalisation  </li>\n<li>Using <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/entlib\" target=\"_blank\">Enterprise Library's</a> Data Access, Exception, Logging, Security blocks.  </li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/IntegrationCenter/ic_sdk-resource.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pay-pal</a> integration for <a href=\"http://dashcommerce.org/\" target=\"_blank\">e-shop</a>  </li>\n<li>Globalisation and Localisation to display web site in Indian Language  </li>\n<li>Content managed pages (allow contributors to compose and publish pages) </li>\n</ul>\n",

This is not a major problem because I was able to re-reference the projects to the latest EntLib 4.0 assemblies.</p> <p>The foremost concept to understand is the Modular structuring of the Web Application. </p> <p>Then comes the understanding of Model-View-Presenter pattern.

Something has gone wrong somewhere....After 30 minutes, I started to suspect the SVNService wrapper. So, instead of going to that level of abstraction, I decided to run the svnserve manually using command prompt. And lo there was Windows XP SP2 in action asking my permission to unblock the port 3690. Phew! that was a relief. After unblocking it, I reverted back to SVNService.\n\nThere ended my initial adventure with SVN which was quite less exciting than my earlier ones with CVS and TortoiseCVS. I am expecting the real thrill when I start using ASP.NET application with SVN.\n",

The code sample provided and refered by Paul D. Sheriff was written using VB.NET and the project I am developing is using C#. So, most of the time I had to replicate the code in C# for which I had to understand VB.NET code also. This process of looking at a code written in another .NET language and writting the same functionality in another .NET language is very fascinating. Some of the syntax I used to take for granted were made to understand.</p><p>\n<br>Now, one might argue that this can be done with other languages also. Advantage in this case is that both VB.NET and C# uses the underlying FCL and thus makes it very easy to do the conversion and hence the learning. Imaging doing the same from Java to C# (I guess this might also be easy owing to the fact that many OSS existing in Java are now being written in C#).\n<br>I've now decided that to understand any code, best method is to re-write the code using some other language. I think VB.NET developers will get a better grip on Object-Oriented languages by using this technique. </p><p>\n<br>Also, for the first time I have thought about the number of lines of coding that has gone in today. Stumbled upon the ‚Äú<a href=\"http://www.anticipatingminds.com/Content/Products/devMetrics/devMetrics.aspx\">devMetrics</a>‚Äù tool for C# code analysis and reporting. Unfortunately, It is not enabling the Analyze... option from the VS.NET 2003 IDE. But, I could generate the report using the Command Line facility and found that the amout of code written today by me is approx. 250 lines. </p><p>\n<br>Ok...

We had gone as far as to see what is an OS loader, how processor executes instructions, where are instructions stored and all those stuff which should have been discussed at the college days.\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Defination of Object.\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Seing the anology of an object and me.\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Seing the anology of a class and human class.\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Class methods and Instance methods.\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Whats the difference b/w an *.exe and *.dll file\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>About PE file format.\n<br>\n</li>\n</ul><p>The most important point of the talk was when I understood that .NET does not have the concept of a <strong>Linker</strong> .\n<br></p><p>There is no linker because there is no such thing like statements in C/C++.\n<br></p><p>I could not resist to go deep further into the Metadata Tables and related basic stuff. Realized as to why Jeff Richter has given priority to Metadata and Assemblies in his excellent book ‚ÄúAdvanced .NET programming‚Äù.\n<br></p><p>I am out to see whats the scenario in Java Technology case.
