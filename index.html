			 <p>There is something satisfying about growing crops. Despite the complexity and uncertainty involved in it, we have farmers (with big and small farms) still farming. The pace of change in farming is also accelerating. Due to lack of labour, famers are forced to use technology to continue the endeavour. In my recent visit to my village, I heard of a business who is renting drones to be used in farms. Could not get it to see in action this time, but hoping to make use of it during next harvest. Here are some photos of the paddy fields from my recent visit.</p>

<p>A founder recently asked me how to structure their new consulting firm: <em>“Should I build a marketing team, sales team, and delivery team from day one?”</em> My immediate thought: <em>Bhai, why?</em> When pressed, they admitted they hadn’t considered how this structure would generate revenue—they just assumed it was “what businesses do.” This mindset, coupled with a story from my past, reveals a critical blind spot: <strong>scaling fixed costs without a revenue-driven strategy is like building a palace on quicksand</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s grab a chai and dissect why this happens.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-fixed-cost-fallacy-when-looking-professional-becomes-a-liability"><strong>The Fixed Cost Fallacy: When “Looking Professional” Becomes a Liability</strong></h3>
<p>Many entrepreneurs—especially in consulting—think hiring teams or slapping “CFO” titles on business cards will magically attract clients. Reality check:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed costs (salaries, swanky offices) create financial handcuffs</strong>. They demand cash even if clients vanish. Look at <strong>Carillion</strong>, the UK construction giant. They chased £5B revenue with aggressive accounting and overexpansion, racking up £1.5B debt. When projects stalled? Bankruptcy. Poof.[<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42731762">1</a>]</li>
<li><strong>Premature scaling kills agility</strong>. A solo consultant spending £3k/month on a “marketing team” before securing clients? That’s like buying a Rolls-Royce to deliver groceries.</li>
<li><strong>Growth ≠ validation</strong>. Remember that overconfidence in growth leads to reckless spending and collapse.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="cautionary-tales-ambition-meets-reality"><strong>Cautionary Tales: Ambition Meets Reality</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Wework’s Global Implosion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Leased posh London offices at £50/sq ft before securing tenants. Result? Bankruptcy. Lesson: <strong>Fancy glass doors don’t pay bills</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Consulting “Floundering Syndrome”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most consulting start-ups fail due to cash flow issues. Why? Many founders hire “delivery teams” before they’ve delivered anything. Or worse—rely on 1-2 big clients. Lose one, and <em>game over</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wise Acre’s Ice-Cold Lesson</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Not UK, but relatable: This popsicle start-up hired 13 staff and leased a factory <em>before</em> securing £1M funding. The 2008 crash hit, the investor backed out, and… bankruptcy. <strong>Revenue first, ego later</strong>.[<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/my-company-grew-too-fast-and-went-out-of-business/">2</a>]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 id="how-to-grow-smart-3-rules-for-surviving-year-1"><strong>How to Grow Smart: 3 Rules for Surviving Year 1</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1. Start as a “One-Person Army”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delay hiring until revenue justifies it</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Ask: “Will this hire directly bring in £?”</strong> If not, skip. That “CTO” title can wait.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Validate Like Your Life Depends on It (Because It Does)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Close 5 clients manually</strong> before even <em>thinking</em> about a sales team.</li>
<li><strong>Use variable costs</strong>: Co-working spaces, freelance designers, pay-as-you-go CRM tools.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Obsess Over Cash Flow, Not Vanity Metrics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Model “worst-case” scenarios</strong>: What if 50% of clients delay payment? You can probably survive a recession by keeping at least 6 months’ runway.</li>
<li><strong>Ditch time-based billing</strong>. Switch to fixed or value-based fees.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-bottom-line"><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3>
<p>Growth isn’t about org charts or titles—it’s about <strong>survival</strong>. As they say: <em>“Jaldi ka kaam Shaitan ka”</em> (Hasty work is the devil’s work). Before scaling, ask: <em>“How will this decision put £ in my pocket next month?”</em> If the answer isn’t crystal clear, slow down.</p>
<p>The UK consulting graveyard is full of firms that prioritised “looking corporate” over being cash-flow smart. Don’t join them.</p>
<p>Also, just because you can write good code does not mean you can run good business. Business is a multi-faceted responsibility in addition to the personal responsibilities you already have. So, learn the basics before jumping in.</p>

			 <p>There are a lot of units in Azure to forecast cost for various services. Yeah, even for pay-as-you-go in the cloud, a decent idea of projected cost is required to justify adoption of a new service.</p>
<p>The most recent for me was CU(s) in relation to Azure Fabric Capacity, which was indeed quite baffling. The usual mistake of thinking it must be something similar to other <a href="https://bolet.io/blog/azure-wtf-units">baffling units like DTUs, SUs</a> etc, could cost us. Especially, as a start-up who have been given certain fixed credits by Microsoft for a year.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://thatfabricguy.com/microsoft-fabric-costs-explained/">The Fabric Guy</a> has written an amazingly detailed article on this matter and this should be a must read for anyone even uttering the word &ldquo;Fabric&rdquo;.</p>
<p>With that confidence of having understood what CU(s) (not CUs) are, it&rsquo;s time to hit the road to get a real feel for it.</p>

<p>I’ve seen it too many times.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://manimaran.net/2025/03/14/part-why-am-i-being.html">Part 1</a>, I explained why consultants get laid off even when revenue is good.<br>
In <a href="">Part 2</a>, I showed how a hybrid offshore-onsite model gives companies more time before resorting to cuts.</p>
<p>Now let’s talk about what many leaders get wrong—<strong>when</strong> and <strong>why</strong> they introduce offshoring.</p>
<p>Because here’s the truth:<br>
By the time you’re scrambling to “cut costs,” it’s already too late to <strong>build culture, delivery maturity, or trust</strong> offshore.</p>
<p>That’s not offshoring. That’s damage control.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-wrong-time-to-think-offshore">The Wrong Time to Think Offshore</h2>
<p>When someone says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Let’s move some of this work offshore—it’ll help our margins.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is usually <strong>after</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bench size has ballooned</li>
<li>Utilisation is under 60%</li>
<li>Pipeline is drying up</li>
<li>The CFO is pacing</li>
</ul>
<p>But trying to build an offshore function <strong>during a crisis</strong> is like trying to build a parachute after you’ve jumped out of the plane.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-leaders-fear-and-why-they-delay">What Leaders Fear (and Why They Delay)</h2>
<p>I’ve spoken to many leaders who hesitate to offshore because they worry about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Losing control of delivery</li>
<li>Hiring people who don’t meet their quality bar</li>
<li>Managing across time zones and cultures</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all valid concerns. But they’re solvable—not through micromanagement, but through <strong>conscious design</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://manimaran.net/uploads/2025/the-culture-map-book-cover.png" alt="Auto-generated description: A book cover displays the title The Culture Map by Erin Meyer, featuring a map design made of colorful human icons, accompanied by the subtitle Breaking Through the Invisible Boundaries of Global Business."></p>
<p>One book that helped me early on was <em>The Culture Map</em> by Erin Meyer. She explains that different cultures interpret feedback, leadership, and communication in <strong>radically different ways</strong>. And misunderstanding those differences can derail delivery—<strong>even when everyone has good intentions</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“When you understand the invisible cultural wiring behind people’s actions, you can adjust your approach—without losing your own identity.”</em><br>
— <em>Erin Meyer, The Culture Map</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s why offshoring isn’t a cost hack. It’s a design decision.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="offshoring-is-a-strategic-design-decision">Offshoring Is a Strategic Design Decision</h2>
<p>Offshoring isn’t about lowering quality. It’s not about replacing jobs.</p>
<p>It’s about <strong>building a resilient business model</strong> from the beginning—one that can absorb market shifts without hurting people or profits.</p>
<p>Here’s the uncomfortable truth:<br>
Consulting firms don’t control client budgets.<br>
They don’t control how long a project lasts.<br>
They often don’t even control pricing.</p>
<p>But they do control <strong>how they deliver</strong>.</p>
<p>And when delivery cost is optimised early, you get:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Margin stability</strong></li>
<li><strong>Strategic flexibility</strong></li>
<li><strong>The ability to protect people—before it’s too late</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="here-is-how-i-used-high-context-leadership-to-align-cultures">Here is how I used High-Context Leadership to Align Cultures</h2>
<p>When I was the Country Lead for one of the Offshore unit, we noticed something odd:<br>
People weren’t taking holidays—even when they had plenty of accrued leave.</p>
<p>It seemed like a good thing at first. But project managers started facing <strong>sudden, unplanned time-off</strong>, often due to burnout or family pressure. That made our delivery <strong>less predictable</strong>, and <strong>more risky</strong>—exactly what clients fear in offshore teams.</p>
<p>Digging deeper, I realised this wasn’t laziness or disorganisation. It was <strong>cultural</strong>.</p>
<p>In many Indian IT companies, taking holidays is still viewed as a negative. It often involves “convincing” a manager. So people <strong>hoarded leave</strong>, only to take it last-minute when it became unavoidable.</p>
<p>In one of our monthly team meetings, I explained how this behaviour—while understandable—<strong>clashes with the consulting business model</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It creates stress for project managers</li>
<li>It adds hidden risk to client delivery</li>
<li>And ironically, it damages trust in the very team trying to prove itself</li>
</ul>
<p>That conversation changed things.<br>
People started viewing holidays not as time-off they needed to justify, but as part of <strong>sustainable delivery planning</strong>.<br>
Over time, this aligned the team’s rhythm with UK norms—without needing policy enforcement or top-down mandates.</p>
<p>This is what cultural alignment <em>really</em> looks like.<br>
Not an HR slide deck—but small conversations that <strong>bridge gaps with context</strong> and <strong>shift behaviours with clarity</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="ask-yourself-and-your-leaders">Ask Yourself (and Your Leaders)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Are we building our delivery model for resilience—or just for speed?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the answer is the latter, it’s a matter of time before the model collapses.<br>
The growth trap doesn’t care how talented your people are. It only cares whether your cost structure can handle volatility.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve seen what happens when you build offshore <em>too late</em>.<br>
I’ve also seen what happens when you do it early—with intent, with care, and with clarity.</p>
<p><strong>One gives you time. The other takes it away.</strong></p>
<p>This wraps up the series. But if you’re still wondering <em>how</em> to start designing this, or want to sense-check your team’s direction, I’m happy to chat.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s build delivery models that protect both people <em>and</em> profit.</strong></p>

			 <p>Finally after many years of frustration, managed to stop the flickering of my 4k monitor when it was connected to my surface book. Turns out that the setting in Edge &ldquo;Use graphics acceleration where available&rdquo; was the culprit. As soon as I turned it off, I think the built-in Windows algorithm that decides to switch the graphics card, stopped doing it and now, I have a peaceful screen helping me focus on building Semantic Data Model.</p>

			 <p>Given a SSH only GIT Repo, was unable to git clone the repo, despite my public key being successfully stored in the remote repo&rsquo;s authorization_keys file.</p>
<p>The git clone command invoked from within the git bash kept prompting for password, but could not authenticate for some bizarre reason. Thought it could be some proxy issue. But no, was able to ping successfully to the server hosting the git repo.</p>
<p>Then came the saviour. Pageant.exe, which gets installed when PuTTy SSH client gets installed in windows. Pageant runs on the system tray and serves like a vault of .ppk keys. After adding my ppk to it, was able to successfully connect to the server using putty. Then I thought git clone will also work.

			 <p>My friend wanted to get started with using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Foundation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for an upcoming Greenfield project. The trouble is Foundation comes in two flavours:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Compass framework does not have a Windows Installer. It is only available as a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ruby Gem<!-- raw HTML omitted --> package, which means we have to install <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ruby for Windows<!-- raw HTML omitted --> first. After this, we follow the following steps to get Compass with Foundation:</p>
<p>Start Command Prompt with Ruby (Run as Administrator)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Execute the command to install the &ldquo;Compass with Foundation&rdquo; package</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>NOTE: If <!-- raw HTML omitted -->gem install<!-- raw HTML omitted --> throws an ECONNECTION related error, it would mostly to do with the command prompt unable to connect to internet and this could be because the computer may be behind http proxy. In such cases, refer to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->gem<!-- raw HTML omitted --> documentation on how to use it with –http-proxy option.</p>
<p>Create a new Compass website called &ldquo;Peakbyte.Web&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This creates the following folder structure</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The detailed structure is better revealed when we open this website using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WebMatrix2<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->_settings.scss<!-- raw HTML omitted --> file contains all the commonly used variables in Foundation. The web developer/designer can either re-use these in their own SCSS by uncommenting the bits as needed.</p>
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->app.scss<!-- raw HTML omitted --> file imports the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->_settings.scss<!-- raw HTML omitted --> file and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the complete foundation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> module as shown below</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->app.scss <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is the main SCSS file. This needs to be processed by the SASS pre-processor to produce <!-- raw HTML omitted -->stylesheets/app.css<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which is the CSS file referenced in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->index.html
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, how does the .scss get processed to .css files? <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>By running the following command, the compass SASS pre-processor will continuously watch for any changes done to the .scss files in the &ldquo;Peakbyte.Web&rdquo; folder. If it detects any change, it will process the .scss files and re-generate the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->stylesheets/app.css<!-- raw HTML omitted --> file.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>So, all that is pending is to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->learn how to write SCSS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and make use of Foundation and Compass modules/features.</p>

			 <p>One word: Incredible!</p>
<p>The Background:</p>
<p>I’ve got the privilege to work on a Greenfield project which involves:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have, in the past, effectively communicated my understanding of “&ldquo;WHAT” needs to be done in the project by providing a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PowerPoint<!-- raw HTML omitted --> presentation. In one case, I earned both the confidence and the trust of my Project Manager. Such is the importance of effectively communicating what I have understood to the stakeholder. While, PowerPoint is sufficient for small projects, with complicated ones, I’ve often found something missing in my arsenal. I intended to learn sketching on paper as a profession, but never found the time to.</p>
<p>But, now there is a prototyping/sketching tool available in the set of software products that I own. Thanks to my attendance at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ReMix UK 2008<!-- raw HTML omitted --> where I got a 1 year <!-- raw HTML omitted -->subscription<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to Microsoft Expression Suite and related software. A couple of weeks ago, Microsoft Expression 3 was released and in there was the new “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blend 3 + SketchFlow<!-- raw HTML omitted -->”.</p>
<p>Never realised how influential <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bill Buxton<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, from whom I bought a signed copy of his “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sketching User Experiences<!-- raw HTML omitted -->” book, would be. The default font used in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SketchFlow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is named “Buxton Sketch”!</p>
<p>I have realised that despite being a non-designer, there is nothing stopping me from sketching the product design well ahead even before coding. That way, as proved in my past experiences, I can focus on “How to do” armed with a list of “What to do”.</p>
<p>I’ve started learning SketchFlow using an excellent sample chapter from the book “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dynamic Prototyping<!-- raw HTML omitted -->”. The language used by the author in this book is simply great. The book does not feed the reader with all detailed steps. It invites the reader to observe and try to implement the features as shown in the figures in the book. This, to me is the first of such experiences. That way, the reading does not get boring and keeps the reader on toes. I can’t wait for the book to be released.</p>
<p>The most impressive of this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sample chapter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is that it covers almost many basic things that as a developer I would need to get started with SketchFlow. Here is a gist:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The step after that would be to create User Stories for the minimal Scrum based project management tool <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scrumy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Then with the great online repository of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Unfuddle<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I should be unfuddling in no time at all to implement the project.</p>
<p>Expecting an exciting August month.</p>

			 <p>When I have a ASP.NET WebSite (NOT WebApplication), I notice the presense of vwd.webinfo in my VS 2005 solution. The problem is the annoyance when it shows as a new source control item. (with a plus sign next to the filename). So, when ever I do a &ldquo;Pending Checkins&rdquo;/&ldquo;Checkin&rdquo;, it is included as part of the pending items.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>At the moment I am taking care to uncheck this file and then do the checkin.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>But, it would be nice to have tell VSS to exclude this file (or set of files) from trying to add to VSS.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also thought about &ldquo;exclude from this project&rdquo; option in Solution Explorer within VS 2005, but then it adds a file called vwd.webinfo.exclude and then this shows up in pending checkins once again.</p>
<p>Using the VSS client, there is a facility to include FileTypes. To my surprise, the *.webinfo was not included but still the VS 2005&rsquo;s VSS plug-in tries to add it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never managed to get an solution to this problem yet. Hopefully something might turn out at a later time.</p>

			 <p>Well, it should not to be mentioned under this blogspace. Nevertheless, for the fun sake of it, I started to learn computer programming (now that it&rsquo;s been nearly 8 years since I wrote my first proper computer program using C ). A friend of mine introduced me to a book he was having as a gift to his dad (who is starting to program). This book is titled &lsquo;Learn to Program&rsquo; and it should be sufficient to say that it belongs to the &lsquo;Pragmatic Series&rsquo; from the Pragmatic Programmers.</p>
<p>The book is amazingly interactive. I laughed and smiled while learning to program using this book. The author has done a commendable job in writing this book in such an lucid manner.</p>
<p>And what can I tell about Ruby? From One-Click Download and Installation upto using the SciTE editor, everything was simple and neat. Not a single problem. The language is also very very light in appearance and does a good job. I am loving it every day. Looks like after a long time, the need for learning a language for fun has really brought some fruit. Ruby is fun. No doubt! I don&rsquo;t have current plans to use it for my projects. But, I may consider it to create website using the Ruby On Rails MVC Web Framework.</p>

			 <p>Hmm&hellip;..After <!-- raw HTML omitted -->VSS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> came <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CVS <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and now after CVS it&rsquo;s time to try out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SVN<!-- raw HTML omitted -->!</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was finally determined to make my machine a build system(with WinXP SP2 Pro) for which I had to install and configure <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CruiseControl.NET<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. For which I had to install VSS. Then I thought of CVS (because, I was comfortable with CVS way of doing things for the past 1 year). Oh&hellip;then I thought of SVN (because, SVN is to be a compelling replacement for CVS).</p>
<p>The best part of SVN is the availability of the free e-book which is quite exhaustive. I was indeed more happy to read the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TortoiseSVN<!-- raw HTML omitted --> e-book because it gave detailed steps to install the SVN Server and not just the TortoiseSVN Client.</p>
<p>Since I did not have Apache Web Server in my system, I prefered the SVNServe type of SVN Server which listens on port 3690. With that I had my svn server setup but before running the server, I read a piece of information in the book which said that the svnserve.exe can be run as a windows service using a wrapper called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SVNService<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Without much thought, I tried running the svnserve as windows service.</p>
<p>But, to my despair when I tried to view the repository which I had just created using TortoiseSVN, I could not find the repository using the repo-browser of TortoiseSVN. Something has gone wrong somewhere&hellip;.After 30 minutes, I started to suspect the SVNService wrapper. So, instead of going to that level of abstraction, I decided to run the svnserve manually using command prompt. And lo there was Windows XP SP2 in action asking my permission to unblock the port 3690. Phew! that was a relief. After unblocking it, I reverted back to SVNService.</p>
<p>There ended my initial adventure with SVN which was quite less exciting than my earlier ones with CVS and TortoiseCVS. I am expecting the real thrill when I start using ASP.NET application with SVN.</p>

			 <p>Today was a day dedicated to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Virtual PC 2004<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>My colleague (infact classmate) Ankur was the first one to have installed Virtual PC 2004 and have it up and running. His setup was quite surprising. He was able to install Virtual PC 2004 on a Windows XP Home edition. His one and only GUEST machine was Windows Server 2003. Infact, Virtual PC 2004 does not officially support this setup. Ankur&rsquo;s need was quite different than mine. Since he had a laptop and a desktop computer he could afford for that kind of setup wherein he would be using the Windows Server 2003 for SQL Server 2000 and Source Control.</p>
<p>Since I don&rsquo;t have the comfort of having a separate physical server, I wanted to install Windows Server 2003 as my GUEST machine with the HOST being a Windows XP Professional. The idea was to create a Virtual Network with the HOST and GUEST being the only nodes in the network. The excellent help provided by Virtual PC 2004 was useful only to get started.</p>
<p>I had to first install the new network adapter(Microsoft Loopback Adapter) using Add Hardware Wizard on my HOST machine and provide the HOST with a static IP address (192.168.1.1) for the connection associated with LoopBack Adapter. The similar proceedure was followed in my GUEST machine with the IP address being 192.168.1.2. I also changed the number of network adapters for the GUEST machine in the Virtual PC Console to include the Microsoft Loopback Adapter.</p>
<p>I restarted my GUEST machine and expected my HOST to detect the GUEST.</p>
<p>That looked like a distant future for me. Basically I could not get it to work.
On googling, I found a link to a Virtual PC guy&rsquo;s blog which explains a subtle <!-- raw HTML omitted -->problem<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. A chicken and egg kind of problem is what he says. Oh&hellip;and here is the actual <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Virtual PC guy&rsquo;s blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Now then I had to realize it will take quite more strain to make this thing work or conclude that it will NOT work. At this point I give up for the day and go to reality by taking a nap and iterating on this stuff tomorrow&hellip;&hellip;..</p>

			 <p>Finally I got a chance to use these tools (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->NAnt<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NUnit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)</p>
<p>The first to be used was NUnit 2.2 and had problems using it because I don&rsquo;t have permissions to install any assemblies into the .NET 1.1 Global Assembly Cache. So, I had to obtain the source and did the manual installation of copying all the required assemblies into a single folder. Then I set up the Path Environment variable to include path where these assemblies were put.</p>
<p>After doing this I went cruising my way creating cool unit tests for my own library under construction. It all worked fine and I used the NUnit-GUI to test my applications.</p>
<p>Then came the second half of the fun! I had to now use the NAnt build tool. So, went ahead and downloaded the binaries for NAnt. As done earlier, set up the environment variable path. I was lazy and tried to use the build of my VS.NET projects using the task. Boom! A enormous list of errors and exception finally thrown at me by the NAnt utility. Now, I did not want to use the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->task<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and went ahead to create my own directory structure (deciding where each output should go into and also keeping in mind the NUnit tests to be run automatically by NAnt) and corresponding task in my build.xml file.</p>
<p>The most frustrating or shameful mistake I did was to forget the fact that xml tagging is case sensitive. So, all I was getting was errors reporting FileNotFound. Spent nearly 2 hours in wain untill I was forced to get reminded of this fact that xml tagging is case sensitive!</p>
<p>And that is not the end of it! When tried to use the task got the exception that NAnt could not find the nunit.framework.dll assembly (as expected, because i have not installed the NUnit assemblies into the GAC and that is because I DON&rsquo;T HAVE PERMISSIONS). Then I went on with the task to execute the “nunit-console.exe”. Now the whole fun started :) Again the problem of nunit.core and nunit.framework assemblies not found problem.</p>
<p>The problem was that I did not bother about nunit.core and nunit.framework assemblies when using the nunit-gui because they were in the same folder as that of nunit-gui.exe. But, now when I run nunit-console, the present working directory will be the location where the build file is present and thus nunit-console cannot find the nunit.core and nunit.framework assemblies.</p>
<p>So, the only solution left for me was to copy the nunit.core and nunit.framework assemblies from the installed folder (the path is hard coded in the build file; I do not like to do that) to the present working directory. That solved the main problem. But I really failed in transforming the TestResult.xml produced automatically by NUnit-console to a proper html output using the “Summary.xslt”. Too much to handle for a single day may be.. So I am giving up on that and am contended with the error output files.</p>
<p>The immediate task facing me now is to use the al.exe for linking the modules just compiled using NAnt&rsquo;s build process into a single assembly and placing in the GAC. But hold on, I do not have permissions to install an assembly into the GAC! Instead, I have the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SSCLI&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GAC. hmmm, that would take more time I guess.</p>
<p>I just wish some kind of USER Specific GAC is provided in .NET! (or may be permissions can be granted to install the assemblies generated and strongly named by the CURRENT USER into the GAC). Got to look into .<!-- raw HTML omitted -->NET Operation <!-- raw HTML omitted -->documentation for all these stuff!</p>
<p>Ok. Now time to shift to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rotor<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and leave .NET for a while! Phew!</p>

			 <p>Oh&hellip;it is a awesome feeling to go back to school to study.</p>
<p>I am now enjoying what I had been waiting for nearly 1 year. I am devoting my full time to books and that too on .NET books which makes me feel good.</p>

In the industry the learning process is overall and not in depth. So, learning during working is remembered more than the learning at university. I could realize this during my first week of my classes in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The University of Hull<!-- raw HTML omitted --> where I am in the .NET MSc in Distributed Systems Development <!-- raw HTML omitted -->course<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I came to know about this course through a blog post which i am not managing to trace back. And now, I am just doing the kind of stuff I&rsquo;ve wanting to do in the past. Some cool low level compiler stuff upto using xml web services.</p>
<p>I have realized that tackling the university learning like the learning while working has lot more advantages. So, I spend a lot of time in the lab and learn the concepts using the text books. The two indespensible books that I carry with me include the famous jeffrey richter&rsquo;s “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Applied Microsoft .NET Framework Programming<!-- raw HTML omitted -->” and Simon Robinson&rsquo;s “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Advanced .NET Programming<!-- raw HTML omitted -->”. The books I am supposed to read include</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And all this fits into the system of education here in UK. Here, more importance is given to learning the theory by practice which is the way I am comfortable.</p>
<p>So currently cruising my way developing the solution for a problem (given as an assessment) using the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Test Driven Development<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->NUnit 2.2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)&hellip; I&rsquo;ve had a head start in Test Driven Approach for developing applications in my previous <!-- raw HTML omitted -->workplace<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>I have now originally copied an idea from Rick. The idea is on how to make myself read a book. Rick started by writing out snippets (in his own words) from a book he was reading. Not just writing it for himself, he was sending them as mails to the collegues.</p>
<p>It so happened that for sometime such mails stopped which prompted me to mail him to ask about the proceedings. He said he shall continue doing it. Which makes him read the book.</p>
<p>I have also started to do something like that now. I am reading the “Essential .NET - The CLR” by Don Box. And not just that. In our internal forum, a new forum has been dedicated to this purpose. (email becomes cumbersome due to maintainance problems).</p>

			 <p>Today, I had to create the skeleton VS.NET solution along with the different .NET projects that would go into the solution for a new project at my workplace.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The reason I chose today as the day for this is that I could see someone starting to go ahead with the project development like some student hacking his way around. I have lost the patience to even look at such kind of coding. Worst is the case when there are files named “WebForm1.aspx” and “WebApplication1.sln”. If not today then never it will be. If substantial amount of coding goes into the project then the natural tendency to resist change occurs and the result is spaghetti code. ( ”Denial is the most predictable of all human responses” - from Matrix - <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.neoandtrinity.net/">http://www.neoandtrinity.net/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->)
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In my previous ASP.NET web application project, majority of the time was spent on setting up the environment and learning new stuff.( VSS to CVS transition, 3-Tier Architecture, User Interface Process, Authoring Web Pages, Web Menu, User Controls, Authentication &amp; Authorization, Coding Guidelines, Javascript and Asp.Net co-existence, DataGrids, Session Expiration, Understanding Struts to understand MVC, Deployment etc&hellip;). In fact, every damn thing was new. Not much time was devoted on implementing most of the suggestions in “Real-world tips for Real-world web application” web-cast by Paul D. Sheriff, President, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PDSA<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Inc. Almost all the tips are right on target and gives the viewer enormous confidence and courage to immediatly try including them in their current project. And quite a few of the tips were incorporated. I was scared to experiment more due to the UIP application block being used (which in itself is mind-bogling stuff).
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->This project will not use the UIPAB and hence the decision to start with business logic coding only when all the real-world tips are included. At this precise moment, I&rsquo;ve included 6 of 10 tips in this project (The coding for which started about 9 hours back). A more <!-- raw HTML omitted -->elaborate <!-- raw HTML omitted -->webcast on N-Tier programming (”Designing LOB applications using Asp.NET”) was refered and hence a different project folder structure has been adopted.

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I had never expected such an event to happen at Christ College. Always wanted to be part of this beautiful campus as a student. Great college with great people around.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Initially, did not know what to talk on. Had no idea about how much the academia is updated with .NET. So, decided to present a very basic talk. The intension was to instill the basics. Clarify all the jargons surrounding .NET technology. Also to give a clear picture on how the various components of .NET fit into the development infrastructure.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Found a paper in ASP.NET starter kit precisely doing that stuff. So, prepared a ppt on the basis of that paper.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I knew that there is no point just going on telling about .NET without involving J2EE. So, wherever possible, gave the parallel. Later found that the audience were comfortable with J2EE because they have it as part of their curriculum.

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->It was just 3 months since the escape to the jungles, the nature invited another visit to the peaks, valleys, jungles, water falls, wild. The timing was not very perfect as my presence would have really helped the team to go ahead with the product release smoothly. Despite the tight schedule, made myself way out of this noisy Bangalore to the bliss of the Western Ghats.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->This trek was to the KudreMukh (The peak that looks like the Face of a Horse) in the Western Ghats of Karnataka.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Western Ghats greeted us with leech bites and steep climbing. All of a sudden, we had the perfect location for lunch and found ourselves surrounded by cloud hidden peaks.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The habbit of not looking up into the skies had not left me. I was just looking at the forest down and when suddenly looked up by chance, could not resist the view of a huge peak slowly being uncovered by the clouds. Felt how small humans are amidst the nature.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Upon reaching the peak (The KudreMukh) thought of .NET was still lurking behind me. In the silence of 3 minutes at the peak, felt the need for a laptop and wondered how good a program can be written at that silence and height. Just missed a laptop.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, thats the highest point I&rsquo;ve ever been as a .NETian. (1892 meters above mean sea level)
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Would be interested in knowing if any .NETian has trekked above this.

			 <p>In my previous <!-- raw HTML omitted -->post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on “Using CVS with VS.NET”, I&rsquo;ve discussed the need to switch to CVS and also the problems faced in doing so.

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->After long time (nearly 2 months) my team has finally become very comfortable with using CVS and VS.NET. Looking back 2 months from today, I get reminded of those days when a whole day would be spent by me wondering who did what and what went wrong. With good push from my team-mate, Jimson, CVS was finally chosen as our Source Control. We did find a good plug-in called “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Push-Ok<!-- raw HTML omitted -->” for VS.NET 2003. An excellent plug-in I should say. But, it came for a price.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->We chose to stick on to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tortoise CVS <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and take the hard way around. We found that apart from files being edited by us, the VS.NET IDE also changed some files (like .csproj). Then with the help of Jimson, found out the right files to got into the CVS repository. Thus, after a half day session for the team on how to use “CVS with VS.NET” things got settled and now everyone seems to be comfortable with the “Copy-Modify-Merge” way of doing things.

			 <p>I had a requirement to develop a quick partially functional demo application. I chose to do the application using ASP.NET. Oh! It was a nightmare to create a web page with nearly 30 controls. The culprit was the requirement to place the controls aligned within tables. I thought it would be easy to do that once I had the controls on the page. It turned out to be a mess later when tables came into existence.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->First, the controls could not be compacted within each cell of the table.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Second, confused whether to use the HTML view of Design view to create the pages.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, I gave up and took the help of an expert (who had expertise in such table-driven web pages design using ASP). Even she had some surprises in store working with the Design view. It eventually turned out to be a remake of the entire web page loosing the existing controls.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->In parallel, one of my team members discovered some way to create the aspx pages using the latest Dreamweaver MX. It looked far decent than the page we had done using VS.NET
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now that I need to work on some more ASP.NET applications, I am at the cross roads having many choices but just dont know which direction to take.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don&rsquo;t get the process followed in creating ASPX pages. Is it that the web pages should be created by one person with all the necessary controls and then the functionality be added by another person or both the aspx and code-behind be done by a single person.

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;An alternative to VSS&rdquo; was the requirement. Decided to plunge into CVS. SA had the CVS server installed on a Linux machine. My task was to find and explore the various CVS clients for Windows.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->First, tried <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->WinCVS<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Then went on to look for CVS plugins for VS.NET. Found <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jalindi Igloo<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Igloo was a major failure inspite of a detailed article on the CodeProject.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then looked into the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->TortoiseCVS<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Inspiring integration with the windows shell. The ease of use was spell bounding. The help accompanying installation gave a detailed look into the two different methodologies for SourceControl namely, Lock-Modify-Unlock and Copy-Modify-Merge. TortoiseCVS uses C-M-M model.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A VS.NET plugin for TortoiseCVS was under development. I tried it but failed to Check out a module.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then looked into the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->SubVersion<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> alternative for CVS. Even this follows C-M-M model. But, the VS.NET plugin developed for SubVersion, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->ankhsvn<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> looks good by seing the Screen Shots. Got to install svn soon and try it. The free book on subversion is excellent.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then went on to read the Microsoft&rsquo;s “Team Development Guide” from <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Patterns&amp;Practices<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This guide is indispensible for VSS and VS.NET users.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Another Microsoft Article from MSDN was very <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->good<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This is related to SourceControl and build control for Web Projects.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->For now, using WinCVS and TortoiseCVS together.

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yesterday, attended the MSDN Yatra&rsquo;s &lsquo;ASP.NET Application Security&rsquo; session by MVP Srinivas Sampath.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Was a very well balanced session.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Started with the Theory of Planning an ASP.NET application for good security.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The different stages at which the security can be provided was explained with a neat diagram.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Usage of SSL was the highlight of the presentation.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also usage of Stored Procedures instead of writing SQL in code was emphasized upon.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->There were around 4 good demos.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->One was how to configure IIS to enable SSL security.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The best was the Login Demo. It demonstrated a good template for authentication. Usage of Salt(Random Number), FormsAuthentication methods to store passwords safely in database.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It was followed by Authorization demo; identifying of User Roles etc.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am going to implement these in my Application.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->That&rsquo;s it for now.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
